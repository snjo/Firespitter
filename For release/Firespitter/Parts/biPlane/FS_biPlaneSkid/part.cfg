description = When wheels are just too high tech! You can actually steer with this thing on the tail of your plane. It will also help slow you down after a landing (without keeping you from taking off from a stand still). For extra protection, use some of these in a non steering setup on your wing tips for added impact protection, just like on the historic Fokker DR1.
